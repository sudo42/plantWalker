      <h2>about this software</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>what is it?</h3>
        <p>
          I call this software <i>"don't walk on the plants"</i>.
          It is based on the concept of minesweeper, but uses plants instead of bombs, because plants are much prettier and way more peaceful.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>how to use it?</h3>
        <p>
          You see the little input boxes at the top of the page?
          The first pair is to specify the width and height of the grid.
          The one below them is for the number of flowers to place on that grid.
          <br/>
          Once you have entered some values (or just leave the defaults in there) click the <em>"generate"</em> button.
          A grid should appear.
        </p><p>
          Use single (primary) click on one of the cells, to explore it.
          With your first click, all flowers will be placed.
          Using a secondary click (the other mouse button, and usually long-pressing on touch screens),
          or pressing at least one of <kbd>shift</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd> while clicking,
          will toggle a flag on any unexplored cell.
          Flags prevent accidentally exploring a cell, and are usually used to mark where you belive flowers are located.
        </p><p>
          Some details:
          The time will start with your first click, and stop when you stepped on a flower or successfully explored all
          all ground withot flowers.
          <br/>
          Minimum value for width and height is <em>1</em>, although I would recommend using at least <em>12 x 6</em>.
          (The visuals might get funny for to low values.
          In additon: you probably want to stay below <em>90</em> or so, as too high values might have a severe performance impact, and a huge grid is probably annoying to play on. )
          You can have <em>0</em> flowers, sure, but not less, and at most as many as cells on the grid.
          (Although I would advise against too extreme numbers.)
          <br/>
          The <i>"generate"</i> button should get a red shadow and be disabled when impossible values are entered.
          (At least for the most obvious logic problems, negative numbers, etc. â€¦ regarding overflows, prcision limits, and similar, please consider my advise against too high values.)
        </p>

        <h3>requirements and technical stuff?</h3>
        <p>
          This little "game" runs entirely in your browser;
          You can even download the files and play it offline from your mass storage device.
        </p><p>
          There are no external libraries, artwork, scripts, â€¦ or any reason to perform additional requests for anything which are not the project files.
          At the moment, i use emoji instead of images, so you probably need a somewhat decent emoji font installed and enabled (dont't worry, this should be the case for most devices nowadays).
        </p><p>
          Your browser defaults are used for the font, and "basic" text colours.
          (As the game itself has some coloured elements it wasn't easily possible to retain default colours there.)
          This has to advantages:
          It is possible that you used some non-standard font and font-size for some reasons (personal preference, dealing with dyslexia, too tiny text by default, â€¦), and in that case:
          Why should I code against your wished for no good reason?
          The second advantage: I didn't have to think about it that much.
          <br/>
          The above also implies: Should you desire a "dark mode" for this page (at least the outer parts), just change your browser defaults.
        </p><p>
          For your browser â€¦ use a recent version of something good, and enable JavaScript.
          (No years old ESR versions, no iexplore.exe, ... probably not Egde or Safari, but you might be lucky.)
          I personally only tested it in recent (beta and developer) versions of Firefox for Linux and Android.
          (On that note: this application is in no way optimised for mobile devices ... so don't expect any decent user experience.)

        <h3>why?</h3>
        <p>
          <i>"Why this project?"</i>, you ask?
          Quite simple:
          I was, among many others, informed about a code challenge in the context of an upcoming events.
          And the task was, to implement a browser-based minesweeper version.
          To be honest, I don't care too much about the challenge itself, it was simply a good idea at the right time.
          (I like coding web stuff, it promised to be fun, and such activities usually help the get other stuff out of my head.)
